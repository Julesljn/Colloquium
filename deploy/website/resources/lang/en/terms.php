        '2' => 'Once the account is created, the user receives personal credentials, including a username and password. These credentials are strictly confidential and must not be shared with third parties under any circumstances. Users are fully responsible for their security and use. Any action performed from the user’s account is presumed to have been carried out by them or with their express authorization. In the event of loss, theft, or suspected fraudulent use of the credentials, users must immediately inform the Publisher via the contact methods provided on the Site. The Publisher will then implement measures to secure the account, such as temporarily blocking access or resetting the credentials.',
        '3' => 'Users acknowledge that their assigned account is strictly personal and cannot be transferred, assigned, or made available to another person without the express permission of the Publisher. Additionally, users agree not to use their account for illegal purposes or in ways that violate these TCU, such as distributing unauthorized content, attempting to bypass security features, or performing actions that may harm the Site or other users. In the event of non-compliance with these obligations, the Publisher reserves the right to suspend or delete the account in question without notice or compensation and to take all necessary measures to protect the interests of the Site and its users.',
        '4' => 'However, users are free to request the deletion of their account at any time, without needing to justify their decision. This request can be made directly through the "My Account" section accessible from the user interface. Once the request is confirmed, the Publisher commits to deactivating the account and deleting the associated data within a reasonable timeframe, in compliance with applicable data protection laws. However, certain information may be temporarily retained for legal reasons, such as compliance with tax obligations or resolution of potential disputes.',
        '5' => 'It is also important to note that deleting an account results in the permanent loss of access to associated services and content, including data generated or stored on the Site. Users are encouraged to back up any information or content they deem important before proceeding with account deletion. Once the deletion process is complete, data recovery will not be possible.',
        '6' => 'Lastly, the Publisher reserves the right to unilaterally delete or deactivate a user account in cases of prolonged inactivity, generally defined as several months without logging into the Site. In such cases, users will be notified in advance by email and will have the opportunity to reactivate their account by logging in within a specified timeframe. This measure is intended to ensure optimal resource management and to avoid the accumulation of inactive accounts.',
        '7' => 'By creating an account and accepting these TCU, users acknowledge that they are bound by the rights and obligations arising therefrom.

This feature allows users to craft questions tailored to the skills they wish to assess, whether general or specific to a particular technical field. The tool offers great flexibility, enabling the customization of questions to meet the unique needs of each company or job position. Once created, these questions can be organized, grouped, or modified at any time via the dedicated dashboard.',
        '3' => 'The Site also offers an advanced feature that allows users to associate keywords with questions. These user-defined keywords serve as evaluation criteria for analyzing candidate responses. For instance, when creating a question about the MVC model, keywords such as "model," "view," or "controller" can be associated. These keywords play a crucial role in the automatic evaluation of responses, helping to determine the relevance and completeness of the answers provided by candidates. This feature ensures an objective assessment aligned with the recruiter’s specific expectations.',
        '4' => 'Another major feature of the Site is the automated analysis of candidate responses through advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The AI, integrated into the system, can analyze written responses in real-time based on the criteria predefined by the user. It evaluates not only the presence of keywords associated with the question but also the coherence, relevance, and structure of the response. In cases of lack of precision or omission of certain keywords, the AI applies strict weighting that reflects the user’s initial requirements. The analysis generated is presented in a clear and detailed report, helping recruiters make informed and quick decisions.',
        '5' => 'The services provided by the Site are offered "as is." This means they are delivered as designed, without explicit guarantees of performance, reliability, or results. The Publisher strives to ensure the highest possible quality for each service but cannot be held responsible for any discrepancies between the results obtained and the users’ specific expectations. AI-generated analyses, though advanced, depend on the parameters defined by users and do not replace human judgment in the recruitment process.',
        '6' => 'The Site is continuously evolving to meet users’ needs, regularly integrating new features or improvements. These may include the addition of new question types, enhanced customization options, or even more refined analyses through AI updates. Users are encouraged to visit the Site regularly to discover the latest features and make the most of them.',
        '7' => 'In summary, the services offered by the Site aim to provide a comprehensive and effective solution for simplifying technical interviews while ensuring a high level of customization and automation.

The Publisher commits to processing these requests within a reasonable timeframe and informing users of the actions taken in response.',
        '5' => 'The Publisher implements technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. However, users are informed that no system is infallible and are responsible for safeguarding their login credentials and immediately reporting any suspected compromise of their account.

        '3' => 'Additionally, when users publish content on the Site, particularly in the context of creating technical interview questions or comments, they automatically grant the Publisher a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, worldwide license to use this content. This license allows the Publisher to exploit, modify, adapt, translate, publish, or distribute the submitted content solely to improve, promote, or maintain the services offered by the Site. This license does not deprive users of their ownership rights over the content they create but authorizes the Publisher to integrate it into its services or use it for legitimate purposes related to the Site’s management and development.',
        '4' => 'Users guarantee that the content they publish does not infringe on the rights of third parties, particularly intellectual property, confidentiality, or privacy rights.

This includes errors in creating interview questions, inadequate configuration of evaluation criteria, or any other actions leading to improper use of the Site’s features.
